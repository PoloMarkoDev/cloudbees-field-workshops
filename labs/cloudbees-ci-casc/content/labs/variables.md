The `variables.yaml` is one of the optional CasC bundle file types. It allows you to define variables to be replaced in the jcasc, items and rbac yaml files.

In addition to `variables` bundle files, variables for replaced may also be defined as controller system properties and as JCasC secrets.

Change the parent bundle to base-rbac. Show that base-rbac has the base bundle as its parent - multi-inheritance.
