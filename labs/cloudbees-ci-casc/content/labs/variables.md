title: "Simplifying Controller Bundles with Variables"
chapter: false

The `variables.yaml` is one of the optional CasC bundle file types. It allows you to define variables to be replaced in the jcasc, items and rbac yaml files.

In addition to `variables` bundle files, variables may also be defined as controller system properties and as [JCasC secrets](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/blob/master/docs/features/secrets.adoc).

In this lab we will use variables to templatize the `rbac.yaml` file.
