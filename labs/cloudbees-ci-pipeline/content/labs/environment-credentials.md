Declarative Pipeline provides an [environment directive](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#environment) that allows specifying key-value pairs at the global Pipeline or `stage` level. In addition to providing environment variables, the `environment` directive also [integrates with Jenkins credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#supported-credentials-type).
